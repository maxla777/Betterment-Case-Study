## Overview and Origin

* Betterment was founded by Jon Stein and Eli Broverman in 2008. An MBA graduate from Columbia Business School (Jon Stein) and a lawyer from New York (Eli Broverman) decided to pair up and disrupt the financial advising industry. Financial investing can be daunting, even for long-time investors but especially daunting for first-time investors. When people first start investing they expect to be confused and not know what they are doing. Jon Stein said in an interview, when asked about the design of the financial industry " Many people intuitivley think that the way things are is the way they should be, or that there is something inherently good about the status quo.". Jon and Eli both set out with the goal of designing a better financial advising approach, and Betterment was born. 

* In 2010 Betterment officially launched at TechCrunch Disrupt New York ```insert link``` and begain speaking with venture capital firms within 24 hours. crunchbase ``` insert https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/betterment ``` shows that Betterment has received a total funding amount of $275 million.

## Business Activities

* Betterment was created because financial advising had previously been extremely tedious and time consuming; maintining your invesment portfolio required you to monitor it frequently, or you could pay someone else to monitor it peridocially (financial advisors). Additionally, previous experience and research was the only way to develop financial strategies on your own. Financial investing was only worth while for people who had extra time and/or additional capital. Betterment saught out to solve these problems by providing people with intellegent investing advice, financial research and monitoring, all at a modest price.

* As millenials are known for being early adopters of new technology, one might say that Betterment caters to this particualr demographic. This can be seen in their digital platform and unique-sounding service "robo-advisor".  That being said, CEO Jon Stein has a quote on Betterment's website(Link) that says the contrary, " The problem is that singling out this one group of people would be doing the rest of the population a tremendous disservice. Regardless of age group, everyone deserves to benefit from smarter technology, especially when it comes to something as important as investing for the future.)". EVen though Jon stein beleives his product is for everyone, the numbers do not lie. Two thirds of their customer base falls into the millenial category. Even though Betterment's portfolio of cusomters is not diverse, it is still profitable, as well as reliable. In the United States, millennials make up the largest living generation at more than 72 million and are projected to spend 1.4 trillions dollars this year.

* Betterment does not require a minimum deposit, although they do offer a premium service that requires a minimum investment of $100,000. Their algorithms work behind the scenes non-stop to maximize every dolloar invested. Lastly, all of this can be done and managed from the convienience of your iPhone or Android.

* Betterment uses (futuristic robots to invest for you) AKA robo-advisors <-- That last statement is false. Betterment utilizes advanced algorythms to fuel their automated invesment platform. When users first sign up they are asked questions about their goals, the ideal time-frame to reach those goals and their susceptibility to risk. Behind the scenes - Betterment's advanced algorythms takes the answers to the questions and uses that information matches the user to a tailored portfolio. Once you start investing in your account, robo advisors (advanced algorythms) continuously look for opportunities to buy or sell investments, while keeping in mind your goal and time-frame. 

## Landscape 

* Betterment falls into the financial investing/advising industry. A few competitors in this realm include Charles Schwab, Findelaity, Blooom and SoFi (Links). To remain competitive in this industry all of these companies use algorythms that evaluate quantitative financial data to better understand the performance of a company and predict wheather it is a good or not-so-good investment. Companies have also adopted hybrid financial advising models; utilizing robo advisors and offering human help when needed. Ultimatley, in order to stay competitive all of these companies had to embrace fintech.

* A few innovative technologies that have been adopted by the companies listed above, as well as others include:

    * Data collection software
    * Blockchain
    * Artifical Intelligence
