## Overview and Origin

* Betterment was founded by Jon Stein and Eli Broverman in 2008. An MBA graduate from Columbia Business School (Jon Stein) and a lawyer from New York (Eli Broverman) decided to pair up and disrupt the financial advising industry. Financial investing can be daunting, even for long-time investors but especially daunting for first-time investors. When people first start investing they expect to be confused and not know what they are doing. Jon Stein said in an interview, when asked about the design of the financial industry " Many people intuitivley think that the way things are is the way they should be, or that there is something inherently good about the status quo.". Jon and Eli both set out with the goal of designing a better financial advising approach, and Betterment was born. 

* In 2010 Betterment officially launched at TechCrunch Disrupt New York ```insert link``` and begain speaking with venture capital firms within 24 hours. crunchbase ``` insert https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/betterment ``` shows Betterment receiving a total funding amount of $275 million.
